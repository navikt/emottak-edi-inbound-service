### 1. How will the data \(Message?\) received from `emottak-edi-adapter` look like? Will we use the same model as Message?

*Pending answer*

### 2. Do I need to use the `adapter client` \(from our utils repo\) in this repo for inbound, or in the other repo for outbound? 

*Pending answer*

### 3. Will NHN send us AppRec or other ebXML message types via the Adapter to Inbound, or perhaps should we store all incoming data as raw binary regardless of its content?

*Pending answer*

## 4. Are we going to standardize a versioning system in the API paths (e.g., /api/v1), and what alternatives have been considered? What are the pros and cons of each approach for our use case?
